# Car Dealership Extended

## Description of the Project
In this project, we are tasked with adding additional functions to the car dealserhip terminal. The new functions include writing a contract of 
sale or lease. The goal is to create a Sale and a Lease class as children of the Contract class. The Contract class is and abstract class. The contract is saved, and appended to the contracts file in the system that can display the history of contracts. The user 
also gains the ability to make a sale or lease in the main menu.
